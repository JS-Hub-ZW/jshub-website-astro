# JS Hub Zim Website

The site for the JS Hub Zim organisation. It has been swithched to [Astro](https://astro.build) as the initial build would not be easily maintanable.

## Tech Stack

- Astro
- TailwindCSS

## Introduction

I switched it to Astro to make it easier to maintain - raw HTML doesn't make sense. There is better composability with Astro.

## Installation

- Clone the project:
  `git clone https://github.com/JS-Hub-ZW/jshub-website-astro`

- Navigate to the project
  `cd jshub-website-astro`

- Install Dependencies
  `yarn or npm install or pnpm install`

- Run the server
  `yarn dev or npm run dev/start or pnpm dev/start`

## â„¹ Info

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`     | Installs dependencies                        |
| `npm run dev`     | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`  |
| `npm run build`   | Build your production site to `./dist/`      |
